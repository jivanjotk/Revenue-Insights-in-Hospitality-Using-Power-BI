# Revenue-Insights-in-Hospitality-Using-Power-BI
## About the Project :-
The Revenue Insights in Hospitality Using Power BI  Project aims to create the Revenue insights dashboard using 3 months of data of a Hospitality Business that has been losing revenue and market share due to ineffective decision-making. With the help of this Dashboard Stakeholders can make a better data-driven decision that can lead to a growth in 20% of overall revenue and market share.

This Analysis aims to identify the total revenue corresponding to market and month, Occupancy % of different properties, and Average rating by customers in the different market areas with various room categories combined.
## Key Metrics :-
1. **RevPAR (Revenue Per Available Room):**
   RevPAR is a key performance metric in the hospitality industry that calculates the average revenue earned per available room in a hotel over a specific period of time. It is widely used to assess a hotel's financial performance and efficiency in utilizing its available rooms to generate revenue.
2. **ADR (Average Daily Rate):**
   ADR refers to the average rental income earned for selling a hotel room per day. It is calculated by dividing the total room revenue by the number of rooms sold. ADR helps hotels determine their average pricing and is a crucial metric in revenue management strategies.
3. **DBRN (Daily Booked Room Nights):**
   DBRN represents the total number of hotel rooms booked by guests within a single day. It measures occupancy and indicates how many rooms are reserved for a specific date. Hotel managers use DBRN data to forecast demand, optimize room allocation, and plan staffing levels.
4. **DSRN (Daily Sellable Room Nights):**
   DSRN refers to the total number of rooms available for sale in a hotel on a specific day. Unlike DBRN, which represents booked rooms, DSRN includes both rooms and rooms available but not yet booked. It provides insights into a hotel's inventory and helps manage room availability and pricing strategies.
5. **Realization %:**
   Realization % is a metric that reflects the efficiency of a hotel's booking and checkout processes. It is calculated by dividing the actual revenue earned from bookings by the potential revenue that could have been earned if all available rooms were sold at the optimal rate. A higher realization percentage indicates effective revenue management and operational efficiency.
6. **Occupancy %:**
    It represents the proportion of available rooms that are occupied or rented during a specific period of time,  expressed as a percentage.

# Key Analysis :-
1.) Elite rooms have generated highest revenue by 554M with occupancy rate of 57.55%.

2.) Exotica Luxury properties generated highest revenue by 317M with an average rating of 3.62/5.

3.) Delhi has the highest occupancy and average rating of 60.44% and 3.78/5, whereas Mumbai generated highest revenue of 660M.

_By comparing occupancy rates, ADR (Average Daily Rate), and revenue metrics,  there is need  for dynamic pricing.  The analysis reveals that the hotel employs a flat pricing strategy, not differentiating rates for weekdays and weekends. There is the importance of adopting dynamic pricing strategies based on demand fluctuations to optimize revenue potential._
